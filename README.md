# SimManager
Web Application  to coordinate running a hospital or university medical simulation programme/courses.

keeps a track of manequin use, which participants and faculty have been involved in which course and scenarios.

In development phase - not for use as yet. Final plan is to host from a web server and interested users access the hosted application (free of charge with no commercial sponsorship).

Contact us via GITHUB if you would be interested in helping add features useful to your simulation programme.
